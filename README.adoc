== Die Tastatur

=== Legal notice

Everything you do with this program you do it on your own risk.
Wrongly used it could harm your hardware.
I am using the names of tools to tell you how _Die Tastatur_ might be used.
I am not owening any rights in using those tool-names and I am not connected to any tool provider mentioned in _Die Tastatur_.
All shortcuts have been extracted from public available documentation.

=== Overview

Sometimes useful shortcurts are cryptical to enter or to remember.
For example how do you undo last git commit locally?
Normally I search the internet, find the answer in stackoverflow and copy the shortcut.
Problem solved so time to forget the shortcut and repeat the search pattern next time I need it.
This is were _Die Tastatur_ comes to help you.

Die Tastatur provides useful shortcuts for several programs, so they can easily be added to a programmable keyboard.

Current state - maybe usefule maybe not.
Look at link:Changelog.adoc[] for changes.

Your contributions are always welcome.

== Example

* You need a programmable keyboard, see <<supported_devices>>
* Go to `die-tastatur-backend/exports` link:die-tastatur-backend/exports[]


** `*.html` - shows how the keyboardlayout would look like
** `*.mwf` - files which can be exported to prehkeytech programmable keyboards
* Install keyboardlayout on your programmable keyboard

== Supported devices

* link:https://www.prehkeytec.com/products/programmable-keyboards/mci-128/[Prehkeytech MCI 128]
* link:https://www.prehkeytec.com/products/programmable-keyboards/mci-96/[Prehkeytech MCI 96]
* link:https://www.prehkeytec.com/products/programmable-keyboards/mci-84/[Prehkeytech MCI 84]

== Supported programs

* E.g. Webstorm, IntelliJ, git, kubectl, docker, kubens, docker-compose, shell
* See `executions.service.ts` for a complete list

== Supported Operating systems

* at the moment mac only
* see `operating_systems.service.ts` for complete list

== Run Die Tatstatur

* install node package manager

 #> cd die-tastatur-backend
 #> nvm use -
 #> npm run install
 #> npm start

* Open one of the shown endpoints in browser

== Export Keyboardlayout

* open http://localhost:3000/keyboard-layouts/
** you see a list of all provided keyboard-layouts
** supported device can be found under: keyboard
** mapped shortcuts can be found under keys
* take id of keyboardlayout and open http://localhost:3000/keyboard-layouts/<id>/file
** this file can be loaded to your programmable keyboard
** example
*** open http://localhost:3000/keyboard-layouts/macosx_webstorm/file
*** contains shortcurts for work with webstorm under macosx
*  take id of keyboardlayout and open http://localhost:3000/keyboard-layouts/<id>/html
** Gives you a simplified graphical overview how keys are mapped
** example
*** http://localhost:3000/keyboard-layouts/macosx_webstorm/file
* Open your programmable keyboard writing software, load exported file and send it to device
** Example for mci 128
*** Open prehkeytech
*** Load exported file
*** Send it your device
* You should now be ready to use your device

== Howto define your own keyboard-layout?

* See `macosx-webstorm-keyboard-test-execution-layout.ts` as an example and how its used in `keyboard-layouts.service.ts`
* When finished go to `die-tastatur-backend/exports` and run `python3 exportAll.py` it will create a file you can upload to your keyboard
* If you think your layout might be useful, please open a PR :-)

== Howto add a new execution to die tastatur?

* See `webstorm_classic_macosx.ts` as an example and how its used in `executions.service.ts`
* If you want to a have a test keyboard layout for you generated use method `generateKeyboardLayoutForExecutionSet` and call it with your executions
** It generates as many layouts as needed on the keyboard you define
* You will find it under http://localhost:3000/keyboard-layouts/ with an id like `testkeyboardlayout<number>`
** number is at least 0 and depends on how many executions you added
** e.g. `testkeyboardlayout0.Intellij classic Linux` for testing an intelliJ linux setup
* If you are happy with your executions go to <<_howto_define_your_own_keyboard_layout>> and put it to something useful

== Thinking about

* Howto handle an shortcut which is not defined by default?
** no support
** Define own keyboard mapping - reduces use everywhere approach

== Thanks for reading

Congratulations for reading.
The right shortcut for undoing the last commit in git locally is `git reset --hard HEAD~1`.

Have a nice day.
