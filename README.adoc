== Die Tastatur

Sometimes useful shortcurts are cryptical to enter or to remember.
For example how do you undo last git commit locally?
Normally I search the internet, find the answer in stackoverflow and copy the shortcut.
Problem solved so time to forget the shortcut and repeat the search pattern next time I need it.
This is were _Die Tastatur_ comes to help you.

Die Tastatur provides useful shortcuts for several programs, so they can easily be added to a programmable keyboard.

Congratulations for reading.
The right shortcut for undoing the last commit in git locally is `git reset --hard HEAD~1`.

Have a nice day.
